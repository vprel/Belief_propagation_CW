#### Forward-Backward belief propagation algorithm

1 - Calculated conditional probabilities.

2 - Wrote a function that displays the factor graph as a dictionary to dispaly distirbutional dependencies.

3 - Function that displays the order in which messages/beliefs/probabilities must be passed.

4 - Two functions. The first sends the random variable and the second sends the factor.

First experience doing statistical programming of this kind, primarily using inbuilt Python libraries and NumPy.
